# My Neovim Configuration

**Description:**
This repository contains my personalized Neovim configuration, designed for quick setup on any device. Initially based on [ThePrimeagen's init.lua](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua).

## Quick Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/erwaen/my-nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Btw, I'm trying to use Vim now!

You think I'm wasting my time? Maybe.
